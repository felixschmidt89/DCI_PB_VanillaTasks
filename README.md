# VanillaTasks

A small Vanilla JavaScript to-do list web app to showcase my recently acquired JavaScript coding skills before moving on to learning React.

## Demo

You can check out the live demo of the app [here](https://vanillatasks.netlify.app/).

## Learnings
Though it felt nice to actually build and deploy a small application for the first time, I mostly learned how not to code:
Using ChatGPT (3.5) for the first time while coding accelerated my speed tremendously, but I also ended up adding some code that appeared to be doing what I wanted, but tbh I did not fully understand the code. This is, in hindsight, something I wouldn't do again.
Also, I did not set up a modular project structure at all, which already made it harder to, for example, add more functionality.
